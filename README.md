North Africa Active Faults
==========================

https://doi.org/10.13117/n-africa-active-faults

This is a database of active fault traces in North Africa for the
Global Earthquake Model Foundation's Global Active Faults compilation.

Data is compiled by Richard Styron and friends from published sources
and public GIS data.

It is very much a work in progress. I will push a release when it's time.
